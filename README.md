# MutViz - Analysis and Visualization of Mutation Enrichments for Selected Genomic Regions and Cancer Types


Try MutViz: http://gmql.eu/mutviz/

<p>MutViz helps to identify <b>enrichments of somatic mutations</b> (single nucelotide variants) falling on predefined or user-specified sets of genomic regions, such as transcription factor binding sites, promoters, specific gene sets and others. <br>Users can choose among <b>several  mutation  datasets</b>  collected  from  public  repositories and  upload  <b>custom  sets  of  genomic  regions</b>  in  a  BED  file format.  <br>Moreover, MutViz provides visualization features _and simple statistics that ease the comparative analysis between different types ofmutations (e.g., ”C→T” is one such type) and different sets of regions and mutations. </p>
