<div style="padding-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
<p>Every cell in the human body contains a chemical substance called deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). DNA is packaged into structures called chromosomes. Each human cell contains exactly 23 pairs, or a total of 46 chromosomes. Chromosomes come in pairs because one set of 23 chromosomes comes from the mother and the other set comes from the father.</p>
<p>
Looking at a single chromosome, DNA is arranged in units called genes. Genes direct the growth, development and function of the human body; everything from eye colour, to height, to how often cells divide. We have approximately 30,000 different genes, each in a specific place on a specific chromosome.

<h4>DNA</h4>
<p>A DNA strand is sequence of four constituent nucleobase (guanine [<b>G</b>], adenine [<b>A</b>], thymine [<b>T</b>], and cytosine [<b>C</b>]). In every chromosome, two long DNA strands form a double helix. The double helix further folds on itself, giving the molecule the typical shape of a chromosome ("X" shape).  In a DNA double helix, each type of nucleobase on one strand bonds with just one type of nucleobase on the other strand. This is called complementary base pairing. <br>The <b>distance</b> between two nucleobases is measured in <b>base pairs (bp)</b>.


<h2>Genes and Tumor</h2>
<p>Each gene has a specific function in the body. Some genes control cell division. When <b>mutations</b> occur in these genes, a cell may begin to divide without control. Cells that divide when they are not supposed to may eventually become a tumor. Therefore, tumor is the result of gene mutations.</p>

<p>
Mutations may be caused by aging, exposure to chemicals, radiation, hormones or other factors in the body and the environment. Over time, a number of mutations may occur in a single cell, allowing it to divide and grow in a way that becomes a tumor. This usually takes many years, and explains why most tumors occur at a later age in life.

<h2>Topologically associating domain (TADS)</h2>


<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8">
TADs are particular three-dimensional structures that can be found in chromosomes. The structure resembles a loop in the DNA, "closed" by what is called a <b>junction</b>. The functions of TADs are not fully understood, but in some cases, disrupting TADs leads to disease because changing the 3D organization of the chromosome may alterate the expression level of a gene (e.g. oncogenes, that are genes that have potential to cause tumor).

<h2>CTCF motifs</h2>
<p>CTCF motifs are fixed-length sequences (19 bp) of the DNA involved in many cellular processes. The primary role of CTCF is thought to be in regulating the 3D structures of the DNA, e.g. binding together the strands of DNA forming a TAD. This kind of motifs can therefore be found within the junction of a TAD.</p>
<b>Mutations that affect a CTCF motif within the junction of a TAD are thought to break the TAD loop, increasing, as a side effect, the expression level of some oncogenes, therefore causing tumor. </b>

        <h2 style="padding: 5px;">MutViz</h2>

        <div style="padding-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
            <p>MutViz helps to identify <b>enrichments of somatic mutations</b> (single nucelotide variants) falling on predefined or user-specified sets of genomic regions, such as transcription factor binding sites, promoters, specific gene sets and others. <br>Users can choose among <b>several  mutation  datasets</b>  collected  from  public  repositories and  upload  <b>custom  sets  of  genomic  regions</b>  in  a  BED  file format.  <br>Moreover, MutViz provides visualization features _and simple statistics that ease the comparative analysis between different types ofmutations (e.g., ”C→T” is one such type) and different sets of regions and mutations. </p>
        
            
            We currently support mutations for the following tumor types:<br>

                    <select style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
                        <option ng-repeat="t in tumorTypes.available">{{t.name}}</option>
            </select>
            <br>
            The database was build starting from <a href="https://icgc.org/">ICGC</a> data.
            
            <br><br>
         

            <h4>Data and Workspace</h4>
            <p>
                Before using the tool, the user must add at least one dataset to the <a href="#!/data">workspace</a>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Either uploading a custom file (BED or narrowpeak). E.g. of BED file: 
                    <pre style="background-color: aliceblue; padding: 15px;">chr10	102639623	102639642	*
chr10	102639678	102639697	*</pre>

                </li>
                <li>Or choosing a dataset from our public repository.<br>
                
                    <select style="margin-bottom: 5px;" ng-model="repoEl">
                        <option ng-repeat="t in repository" ng-value="t">{{t.name}}</option>
                    </select>
                    <div ng-bind-html="repoEl.description" style="background-color: #f6f6ff;"></div>

                </li>
            </ul>

            The workspace structure is stored on the browser's local storage and will be available until the local storage is deleted.  Therefore, closing the browser or reloading the page won't erase data in your work space. However, uploaded region sets will disappear from the workspace as soon as their survival time on our database expires (few days).


            <!--h4>Horizontal axis and interaction</h4>

<p>In all the plots the horizontal axis represents the distance of a mutation w.r.t. the center of a region. The domain can be enlarged or shrinked by using the availble range-selector component.</p>
<br>
<img src="img/slider.png" width="500">

<br><br>

<h4>Binning and interaction</h4>
Data binning is used in all the plots. The <b>bin size</b>, in base pairs, can be changed by using the form available on the left side of each plot. Bins are centered on the motif (i.e. on 0).
<br><br>
<img src="img/bin_size.png" width="200">

<br><br>
<h4>Mutation Set selector</h4>
<p>The tooldbar on the left of every plot allows to restrict the set of mutations to consider. Mutations in the defined set must be independed (e.g. you cannot choose "A > *" and "A > C"). If the set contains conditions that are not independed an error message will popup and the plot will not be updated until the defined set is fixed. </p>

                    Given a catalogue of mutational <b>signatures</b> S and a set of somatic mutations M found in a given tumor genome, exposures E can computed ("signature refitting"). The exposures predict what fractions of the mutations can be attributed to the given signatures. Exposures are computed such that the exposure-weighted sum of signatures reflects the distribution of mutation types in the tumor genome.<br><br>

                    Here, the set of somatic mutations M used are only those mutations which fall onto the region set specified by the user. Since, however, the region set may have a largely different trinucleotide content than the whole genome, for which mutational signatures have been originally been determined, the signatures are adjusted according to the trinucleotide content of the region set prior to determining exposures.<br><br>
                    
                    This visualization shows an <b>bar-plot</b> in which, for each signature (horizontal-axis), the corresponding exposure (verical-axis) is reported. Alternatively, a <b>box-plot</b> for each signature shows the distribution of exposures over donors.<br><br>
                    
                    For higher accuracy in signature refitting, when the <b>threshold</b> is enabled (e.g. <code>threshold=N</code>), the tool will consider only tumors (synonyms: donors, patients) for wich more than N mutations overlap regions in the provided region-set. In case less than 5 tumors have more than N mutations, the mutations are merged and an estimation of the average signature exposure is provided.<br><br>
                           
                    In case the box-plot visualization is selected, hovering the box-plot with your mouse you will be able to get more information on the distribution and on outliers (e.g. you can get the donor-id associated to an outlier).<br><br>
                    Use the toolbar on the left to select:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A <b>region set</b>, among the ones added to the <a href="#!/data">workspace</a>.</li>
                        <li>A <b>tumor type</b>: only mutations for the selected tumor type will be displayed. You can further <b>filter mutations</b> by providing a predicate on the <b>clinical condition</b> of donors associated to the selected tumor type. Click on the filter-button next to the tumor-type selector to open the predicate editor. On top of the editor you will see the number of donors matching the current predicate.</li>
                        <li>A <b>threshold</b> (N): when enabled and set, only donors (tumors) with more than N mutations overlapping the region-set will be considered.</li>
                        <li><b>Mutation classes</b>: only mutations belonging to the selected classes will be displayed. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br><br>
                    
                    Once the plot is ready the number of considered patients will be displayed in the toolbar. <br><br>
